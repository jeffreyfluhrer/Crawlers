Notes on progress for web scraping portion of project:

3/12/2018
----------------
Created initial python code for scraping a wiki page that contains
a list of north american resorts.  

This code will create a csv file of resort names with their locations
and prices.

Removed the resorts from Canada out of the list

3/14/2018
----------------
Created a python script that is able to crawl through the skiresortsinfo page

TODO: Need to add a scraper for it to extract all the data from each subordinate webpage

3/25/2018
----------------
Added test_crawler2.py which has the ability to scrape the resort.info web and grab the resort info from
the pages.  This does so on a 50 page basis.

TODO:  Need to take the resort-info files and merge them together to form an entire resort page
that can be loaded to the SQL database.

3/25/2018
-----------------
Added weather info to the resort-info table

3/26/2018
-----------------
Created a scraper that pulls down all the locations for all resorts in US
named wikiscraper2.py.  The list is stored in resort3.info

TODO:  Need to merge data from resort2.info with resort3.info and then
should be able to fill up the database except for the travel info.

3/28/2018
------------------
The massager will create all four tables that can be loaded in to the SQL database.  A bit primitive still.

Fixed a bug with endSeasonDate for resort table

3/29/2018
-------------------
Added the ability to scrape out the city and state where the resort is located

Added the correct cities and states to the massager
