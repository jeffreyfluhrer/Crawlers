    *  ------------ Algorithm outline ------------
    *  There are approximately three parameters to optimize on - rating, budget and difficulty
    *  Need to test the user on at least six cases and then start to estimate what is important and what is not
    *  The first six cases should start within the budget constraint to get at least six data points in the
    *  database.  After this, a scoring system can be used to select the next likely selections.
    *  The scoring system works by taking likes and dislikes of the resorts and comparing the
    *  budget, rating and level versus the average values of the resorts and penalizing for dislikes 
    *  and rewarding for likes.  The weights are then used to define the where clause of a query.
